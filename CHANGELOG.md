# Changelog

All notable changes to Buried Spire Quest will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.2.1] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- CSP: added `*.firebaseapp.com` to frame-src and `unsafe-inline` to script-src for Firebase auth
- Bump service worker cache version to force browsers to load updated CSP headers
- Leaderboard name entry popup never appearing due to `window.InputManager` being undefined (`const` doesn't create window properties)
- Leaderboard silently failing on Safari due to Firestore streaming fetch being blocked (added `experimentalAutoDetectLongPolling`)
